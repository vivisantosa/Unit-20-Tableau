This assignment is to create an interactive dashboard to tell the story of New York citibike using Tableau Public. <br>

### Data Manipulation <br>
As I use data across the years, the first data manipulation that is needed is to adjust the 2015 and 2016 data set. I use jupyter notebook-pandas to achieve that. To make chart cheration more smooth I also changed the data type for the gender and gave them aliases. <br>

From reading the file, I understand that the trip duration within the contract is 30 min for customers and 45 for subscribers. Beyond that they will be charged additional fees. Because of this, rides beyond a few hours should be an exception. Bike that does not get returned beyond 24 hour is considered lost and is heavily fined. I performed analysis on different ride duration lengths - despite believing that most of trip duration above 6 hrs is a lost bike, determining which one beyond a certain hour before 24 is considered lost is difficult, thus decided only to filter rides that are beyond 24 hrs. <br>

As I worked on the file, I noticed some oddity in the data set, where a certain age group has above normal number of rides. After doing various filtering, I figured out that the above normal number actually contributes to a very specific group - born in 1969, gender 0 (not available), and have an extraordinary high trip duration. This is a subset that I need to filter from my data although I am still challenged on the techniques to do that. <br>

### Visualization 

The first story that I chose to explore is the year by year growth of citibike. Because of the size of the data, I chose to only use the data from each June report of the data.<br>

The second one is the exploration characteristics and information of a particular bike station. A person can choose and click a station from a list or in the map and the information will be adjusted to the particular station.<br>



## NOTES 
I originally built the visualization in tableau desktop student edition, unknowingly that it is not possible to post to tableau public from it.  I have to recreate my visualization and decided not to remake the whole 8 dashboards that I did in tableau dashboard. I take screenshots of the pages that I didnâ€™t recreate and attached them at the end of my tableau public as pictures<br>
